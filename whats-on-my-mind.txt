Assignment 2 was fun
In the submitted file there is no file for both console and file output
I deleted that
Now those just uses console

Nonetheless, the token files are a 100% match
Log files are matching but as the sample uses previous batch's hash func,
not ours one, sdbm, that's why the symbol tables aren't matching
I have tried with previous hash and then it matches.

Assignment 2 done
